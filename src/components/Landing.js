      <h1>Welcome to Cardhelper</h1>
      <p>Cardhelper is a spaced repetition flashcard app designed to focus on personal areas of struggle for academic and educational topics, as well as reduce overall study load.</p>
      <p>Cardhelper achieves this by assigning due dates to flashcards based on user inputted difficulty options so that difficult cards show up more often and easy cards show up at later dates when retention decreases.</p>
